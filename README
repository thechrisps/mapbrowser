Add new npm packages:
- npm install <<package>>
- npm install --save-dev parcel-bundler

Start the npm dev server:
- npm start

Secrets management:
- Make sure there is a .env file in the root
- Files should be of format key=value
- Required entries in .env file:
    - bingkey=######### (from bingmapsportal.com)

Build full distribution
- npm run build
- copy dist/ to web server

To debug
- Use Visual Studio Code with Chrome deubgger plugin
- From a terminal, in the project directory, npm start & wait for build to complete
- Run from VSC, using included launch file
- (You must debug this way, as parcel transpiles and this launch file includes the correct source maps)

To run on Azure App Service
- Install Azure plugin for Visual Studio Code
- Log into Azure in VSCode
- Login to the Azure portal (portal.azure.com)
- Create a new app service (free tier is fine)
- In the Azure browser in VSCode, open up your Azure subscription, click the new app service you have just created.
- There will be a little blue up arrow next to the app service name that says "Deploy". Click that.
